After years of work, your film crew has finally secured the possibility of capturing a real ghost! Take the crew into the house to document and identify the paranormal activity.
Everyone in the group must be assigned a role to take on in the film crew. The roles are: Director, Cameraperson, Soundperson, and Talent/Actor. Everyone must stick to their assigned roles (can be shuffled upon someone's death). Until the movie is complete.

Director: Direct the film - make sure the camera angles are good, advise the talent on what to do or say (if they need help), and reassign roles if a member dies.
Cameraperson: The only person insured to operate the expensive cameras. Use video and photo cameras to make sure everything is documented. Make sure you keep rolling on the talent!
Soundperson: The only person insured to operate the expensive sound equipment. Use any sound-based equipment to make sure everything is documented and the sound stage is setup.
Talent: Stay in front of the camera, operate the more flashy equipment, and commentate everything! Don't want those viewers getting bored.
