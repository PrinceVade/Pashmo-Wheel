In a public channel, roll the !trait command to receive a random trait.
The next round, this trait applies to the entire team.

In a DM to the bot, run the !item <trait> command in order to get a compatible banned item.

Some traits have "Shared" modifiers, indicating that gameplay is different when playing in "Shared" mode.
If the trait has a "complete" condition (and no "Shared" overwrite) only 1 person is able to complete it successfully.
Whoever does: may receive a !bonus.

If the team guesses the ghost correctly - congratulations! Everyone must vote for an MVP to !bonus.
In the event of a tie, another election is held for ONLY the tied participants.

The MVP then chooses an LVP to receive a !punish.
