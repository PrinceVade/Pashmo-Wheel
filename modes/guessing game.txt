This mode uses the standard rule set: use "!rules standard" in order to refresh your memory.

Additionally, everyone must attempt to hide their trait as best as possible.
At the end of the round, all players guess the other 3 players traits.

If any 1 player gets 2 traits correctly, they receive a !bonus.
If any player has their trait guessed correctly, they receive a !punish.
