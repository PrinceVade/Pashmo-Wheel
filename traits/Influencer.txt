One week ago, you were at the cusp of 100k. A few more people and your dream would be realized.
Late, on a Tuesday night, as you posted your last highly editted pool photo; you decided to check the insights on your profile growth.
Nothing. Nothing for the past 7 days. Your content was stale. You had already debunked the Governments latest claims of hiding Aliens and Bigfoot and there was nothing left.
Greater creators than you had already shown 9/11 and the moon landing were faked. What else was there? What could put you over the edge?
At 5:30am, your answer hit you like pre-workout. This week's Chad-cast topic was Ghosts: Were they real? Who had been silenced? What did the Government know?
Thus, you set out on the greatest adventure of your time: To prove ghosts were real. You can't leave until you have it. You MUST have it.
FOR. THE. GRAM!
